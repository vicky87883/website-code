Addition and Subtraction of Integers
</h3>
<br>
<p><b>Let us discuss how to perform addition and subtration in integers.</b></p>
<p>
In <a href=what-is-maths>mathematics</a>, addition and subtraction are fundamental arithmetic operations used to combine or separate quantities.
Addition is the process of combining two or more numbers to find their total or sum. For example,<b> adding 2 and 3 gives us 5 (2 + 3 = 5)</b>.
Subtraction, on the other hand, is the process of taking away one number from another to find the difference between them. For example, subtracting "3" from "7" gives us <b>4 (7 - 3 = 4)</b>.
Both addition and subtraction are important in everyday life, as well as in more complex <a href=what-is-maths>mathematical calculations</a>. They are the building blocks for more advanced operations and problem-solving in mathematics.
</p>
<br>
<b>➱ 2 + 3 = 5</b><br>
<b>➱ 5 + 3 = 8</b><br>
<b>➱ 7 - 3 = 4</b><br>
<b>➱ -9 + 6 = -3</b><br>
<hr class=style-two>
<h4>➱ History of Addition and Subtraction:</h4><br>
<p>The history of addition and subtraction dates back thousands of years. Ancient civilizations, such as the <b>'Egyptians'</b> and <b>'Babylonians'</b>, used simple methods of counting and basic arithmetic to trade goods and manage resources.
In ancient times, people used their fingers and other objects to count and perform simple calculations. As societies advanced, various numerical systems were developed, like the <b>Roman numerals</b> and later the <b>Hindu-Arabic</b> numeral system, which made addition and subtraction more efficient.<br><br>
<b>➱ Ancient Egyptian Addition:</b>
The ancient Egyptians used a symbol that resembles an upside-down <a>"U" (∩)</a> to represent addition.
<br>
<b>➱ Ancient Egyptian Subtraction:</b>
For subtraction, the ancient Egyptians used a symbol that looks like a tilted <a>"L" (⌢)</a>.
<br>
<b>➱ Babylonian Cuneiform:</b>
The Babylonians used cuneiform script to represent numbers and calculations. They used specific cuneiform signs for addition and subtraction operations.
<br>
<b>➱ Roman Numerals:</b>
The Roman numeral system, which was widely used in ancient Rome, represented numbers using letters of the Latin alphabet. While there were no specific symbols solely for addition and subtraction, the combination of different numerals signified these operations.

<h4>➱ Rules Of Addition and Subtraction:</h4><br>
<h5>Rules for addition</h5>
<p>
<b>1. Commutative Property</b>: The order of numbers doesn't affect the result of addition.
Example: a + b = b + a<br>
<b>2. Associative Property</b>: The grouping of numbers doesn't affect the result of addition.
Example: (a + b) + c = a + (b + c)<br>
<b>3. Identity Element</b>: The sum of any number and zero is the number itself.
Example: a + 0 = a<br>
</p>
<br>
<h5>
Rules for Subtraction:
</h5>
<p>
Subtraction is the inverse operation of addition. To find the difference between two numbers, you can add the opposite (negative) of the second number.<br>
<b>Example</b>: a - b = a + (-b)<br>
<b>1. Subtraction with Zero</b>: Subtracting zero from a number results in the number itself.
Example: a - 0 = a<br>
<b>2. Subtraction with the Same Number</b>: Subtracting a number from itself results in zero.
Example: a - a = 0<br>
<b>3. Subtraction with Negative Numbers</b>: Subtracting a negative number is the same as adding its positive counterpart.
Example: a - (-b) = a + b<br>

<p>➱ Addition between two negative numbers</p>
<p>➱ Addition between a positive number and a negative number</p>

<p>When ever a positive sign(+) added with a greater negative(-) sign number then the negative sign number have high precedence
and when negative sign number added with greater positive(+) sign number then the positive sign number have high precendence.

<p><b>➱ Note Some important points:</b></p><br>
<div class=list-bg>
<ul>
<p>➱ Adding two positive integers results in positive integer.</p>
<p>➱ Adding two negative integers results in a sum of integers with a negative sign.</p>
<p>➱ The addition of a positive and a negative integer gives either a positive or negative-sum depending on the value of the given numbers.</p>
</ul>
</div>

<br>
<h4>➱ Multiplication of Integers:</h4>
<p>
In mathematics, multiplication is an arithmetic operation used to find the total of repeatedly adding the same number. It's a way of combining two or more quantities to determine their product.
For example, if you have 3 groups, each containing 4 apples, you can find the total number of apples by multiplying 3 by 4. This gives you the product, which is 12 apples in total.
In simple terms, multiplication is like a shortcut for repeated addition. It helps us calculate the result when we have multiple groups or quantities of the same size. It's an essential operation in everyday life, mathematics, and various fields, such as science, engineering, and finance.
