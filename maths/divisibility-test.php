Tests of Divisibility:
</h3>
<br>
<p><b>Let us test the divisibility of various numerals in mathematics.</b></p>
	<hr class="style-two">
	
<p><b>➱ Divisibility By 2:</b><br>
A number is divisible by 2 if its unit digit is any of 0,2,4,6,8.<br>
<b>Ex.</b> 58694 is divisible by 2, while 86945 is not divisible by 2.
</p>
	<hr class="style-two">
<br>
<p><b>➱ Divisibility By 3:</b><br>
A number is divisible by 3 only when the sum of its digits is divisible by 3<br>
<b>Ex.</b>(I) In the number 695421, the sum of digits = 27, which is divisible by 3. Therefore 695421 is divisible by 3.<br>
(II) In the number 948653, the sum of digits = 35, which is not divisible by 33. Therefore 948653 is not divisible by 3.
</p>
	<hr class="style-two">
	
<br>
<p><b>➱ Divisibility By 9:</b><br>
A number is divisible by 9 only when the sum of its digits is divisible by 9<br>
<b>Ex.</b>(I) In the number 246591, the sum of digits = 27, which is divisible by 9. Therefore 246591 is divisible by 9.<br>
(II) In the number 734519, the sum of digits = 29, which is not divisible by 9. Therefore 734519 is not divisible by 9.
</p>
	<hr class="style-two">
	
<br>
<p><b>➱ Divisibility By 4:</b><br>
A number is divisible by 4 only if the number formed by its last two digits is divisible by 4.<br>
<b>Ex.</b>(I) 6879376 is divisible by 4, since 76 is divisible by 4.<br>
(II) 496138 is not divisible by 4, since 38 is not divisible by 4.
</p>
	<hr class="style-two">
	
<br>
<p><b>➱ Divisibility By 8:</b><br>
A number is divisible by 8 only if the number formed by its last three digits is divisible by 8.<br>
<b>Ex.</b>(I) In the number 16789352, the number formed by last 3 digits, namely 352 is divisible by 8. Therefore 16789352 is divisible by 8<br>
(II) In the number 576484, the number formed by last 3 digits, namely 484 is not divisible by 8. Therefore 576484 is not divisible by 8.
</p>
	<hr class="style-two">
	
<br>
<p><b>➱ Divisibility By 10:</b><br>
A number is divisible by 10 only when its unit digit is 0.<br>
<b>Ex.</b>(I) 7849320 is divisible by 10, since its unit digit is 0.<br>
(II) 678405 is not divisible by 10, since its unit digit is not 0.
</p>
	<hr class="style-two">
	
<br>
<p><b>➱ Divisibility By 5:</b><br>
A number is divisible by 5 only when its unit digit is 0 or 5.
<br>
<b>Ex.</b>(I) Each of the numbers 76895 and 68790 is divisible by 5.
</p>
	<hr class="style-two">
<br>
<p><b>➱ Divisibility By 11:</b><br>
A number is divisible by 11 only if the difference between the sum of its digits at odd places and the sum of its digits at even places is either 0 or a number divisible by 11.
<br>
<b>Ex.</b>(I) Consider the number 29435417<br>
(Sum of its digits at odd places) - (Sum of its digits at even places)<br>
= (7 + 4 + 3 + 9) - (1 + 5 + 4 + 2) = (23-12) = 11, which is divisible by 11.<br>
∴ 29435417 is divisible by 11.
<br>
(II) Consider the number 57463822.<br>
(Sum of its digits at odd places) - (Sum of its digits at even places)<br>
= (2 + 8 + 6 + 7) - (2 + 3 + 4 + 5) = (23 - 14) = 9, which is not divisible by 11.<br>
∴ 57463822 is not divisible by 11.
</p>
	<hr class="style-two">
<br>
<p><b>➱ Divisibility By 25:</b><br>
A number is divisible by 25 if the number formed by its last two digits is either 00 or divisible by 25
<br>
<b>Ex.</b>(I) In the number 63875, the number formed by last 2 digits, namely 75 is divisible by 25.<br>
∴ 63875 is divisible by 25.<br>
(II) In the number 96445, the number formed by last 2 digit, namely 45 is not divisible by 25.<br>
∴ 96445 is not divisible by 25.<br>
</p>
	<hr class="style-two">
<br>
<p><b>➱ Divisibility By 7 or 13:</b><br>
Divide the number into groups of 3 digits (starting from right) and find the difference<br>
between the sum of the numbers in odd and even places. If the difference is 0 or divisible<br>
by 7 or 13 (as the case may be), it is divisible by 7 or 13.
<br>
<b>Ex.</b>(I) 4537792 ➜ 4 / 537 / 792.<br>
(792 + 4) - 537 = 259, which is divisible by 7 but not by 13.<br>
∴ 4537792 is divisible by 7 and not by 13.<br>
(II) 579488 ➜ 579 / 488.<br>
579 - 488 = 91, divisible by both 7 and 13.<br>
∴ 579488 is divisible by both 7 and 13.
</p>
	<hr class="style-two">
<br>
<p><b>➱ Divisibility By 16:</b><br>
A number is divisible by 16, if the number formed by last 4 digits is divisible by 16.
<br>
<b>Ex.</b>(I) In the number 463776, the number formed by last 4 digits, namely 3776, is divisible by 16.<br>
∴ 463776 is divisible by 16.<br>
(II) In the number 895684, the number formed by last 4 digits, namely 5684, is not divisible by 16. <br>
∴ 895684 is not divisible by 16.
