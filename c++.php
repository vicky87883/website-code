<br>
	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<br>
	<p>
C++ is a general-purpose programming language that was developed as an extension of the C programming language. It was created by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs in the early 1980s with the aim of adding object-oriented programming (OOP) features to C. C++ combines both procedural and object-oriented paradigms and provides a powerful and efficient programming language for developing a wide range of applications.
</p>
<br>
	<h3>History of C++ Programming:
</h3>
		<br>
	<p>
C++ has its roots in the C programming language, which was developed by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs in the 1970s. Bjarne Stroustrup started working on C++ in 1979 as an extension of C to add object-oriented features. The language gained popularity in the 1980s and 1990s due to its efficiency, flexibility, and support for object-oriented programming. C++ has since evolved through various revisions, with the most recent standardized version being C++17 (published in 2017). The C++ language continues to evolve, with new features and improvements introduced in subsequent versions.

</p>
	
	<br>
	<h3>Sample program:</h3>	
	<br>
	<div class="p85 " style="background:#dcdcdc;border-radius:10px;padding:40px">
		<p>
	 Certainly! Here's a unique C++ program that generates a Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number using recursion:
		</p>
<br>

		<pre>
#include <iostream>

// Function to calculate the Fibonacci sequence recursively
int fibonacci(int n) {
    if (n <= 1)
        return n;
    else
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
}

// Function to print the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number
void printFibonacciSequence(int limit) {
    for (int i = 0; fibonacci(i) <= limit; ++i) {
        std::cout << fibonacci(i) << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    int limit;
    std::cout << "Enter the limit to generate Fibonacci sequence: ";
    std::cin >> limit;

    std::cout << "Fibonacci sequence up to " << limit << ":\n";
    printFibonacciSequence(limit);

    return 0;
}
    </pre>
	</div>
<br>
	 <!-- It will create a division for 
        compiler and embed that into 
        web page-->
    <div data-pym-src=
"https://www.jdoodle.com/iembed/v0/JRp">
    </div>
  
    <!-- This script tag contains the 
        javascript code in the written URL -->
    <script src=
"https://www.jdoodle.com/embed/v0/6nAP"
        type="text/javascript">
